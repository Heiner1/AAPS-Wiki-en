**When you decide to build your own closed loop always think about security and impact of all your actions**

## General

* AndroidAPS is a just a tool to help you manage diabetes. Not something you can install and forget!
* Don't absolutely trust any device taking control of insulin delivery. Watch it all the time, learn how it works and learn how to predict it's actions.

## SMS Communicator

* If you enable SMS Communicator, consider what could happen when the phone enabled for remote commands is stolen! So always protect it at least by PIN code
