Looping can reduce the pump battery faster than normal use.  If you unexpectedly run low then the battery from the blood test kit can be used.  Tricks to minimise battery drain include:
* reduce the length of time the LCD stays on (within DANA settings menu)
* reduce the length of time the backlight stays on (within DANA settings menu)
* select notification settings to a beep rather than vibrate (within DANA settings menu)
* only press the buttons on the pump to reload, use AndroidAPS to view all history, battery level and reservoir volume.


Within your Circadian Percentage Profile you have another chance to set your units to mg/dl or mmol/l separate to the preferences menu, don't forget to update this in both places! 

If you don't want your preferences to be easily changed then you can password protect the preferences menu by selecting in the preferences menu "passwird for settings" and type the password you choose. The next time you go into preferences menu it will ask for that password before going any further. If you later want to remove the password option then go into "password for settings" and delete the text.
