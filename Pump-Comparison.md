If you only can get the Combo or pay out of your own pocke - it is a solid pump. And loopable. I'd chose it over a 640g any day.

The advantages of the RS still would me get an RS:

* Sooil did state that controlling the pump from a phone (did not not specifically stated looping) would NOT void the warranty. IME-DC stated they would just hand out a replacement send the pump to Sooil - so they wouldn't even know if you were looping or not. This makes the Dana pumps the only pumps that are under warranty while looping. (Roche excludes any use that is not in their manual.)

* The R/RS connects to almost any phone with Android >= 5.1 without the need to flash lineage. Yesterday, while testing my combo setup my phone broke. You usually easily find any phone that works with the Dana pumps as quick replacement... not with the Combo. (This might change in the future when 8.1 gets more popular)

* Initial pairing is simpler with the Dana*R/RS. But you usually only do this once so it rather only bothers you if you want to test a new feature with different pumps.

* So far the Combo works with screen parsing. In general that works great but it is slow. For looping this does not matter much as everything works in the background. Still there is much more time you need to be connected so more time where the BT connection might greak. When preparing food I tend to run around. 

* The Combo vibrates on TBRs, the R vibrates (or beeps) on SMB. As my APS sets much more TBRs than SMB (especially during the night), the R vibrates less. The RS should be configurable that it does on neither (Justin Walker?)

* Reading the history on the RS in a few seconds with carbs makes it possible to switch phones easily while offline and continue looping as soon a soon as some CGM values are in

* All pumps AndroidAPS can talk with are waterproof on delivery. Only the Dana pumps are also "waterproof by warranty". 

The Combo of course is a solid pump. And loopable. It also has the advantage of many more infusion set types to chose from as it has a standard luer lock. And the battery is a default one you can buy at any gas station, 24 hour convenience store and if you really need one, you can stea^w borough it from the remote control in the hotel room ;)
