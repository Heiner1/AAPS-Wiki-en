Some of the features in AndroidAPS are from OpenAPS oref0 code so please refer to the OpenAPS docs for these:
* [Advanced Meal Assist (AMA)](http://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/walkthrough/phase-4/advanced-features.html#advanced-meal-assist-or-ama) after you give yourself a meal bolus, the system can high-temp more quickly after a meal bolus IF you enter carbs reliably
* [Autosens](http://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/walkthrough/phase-4/advanced-features.html#auto-sensitivity-mode) analyze historical data on the go and make adjustments if it recognizes that you are reacting more sensitively (or conversely, more resistant) to insulin than usual
* [Temporary Targets (Eating Soon and Activity Mode)](http://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/walkthrough/phase-4/advanced-features.html#eating-soon-and-activity-mode-temporary-targets) Temporary or “temp” targets are ideal for when you want the loop to adjust to a different target level for a short period of time (temporarily) for example when you plan on eating or exercising
