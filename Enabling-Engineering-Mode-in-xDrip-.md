Enabling Engineering Mode in xDrip+ activates extended and experimental features within the app. To do this, on the xDrip+ home screen tap the Treatment Note icon on the right side of the screen (this resembles a sticky note with a "+" icon on it). Then in the text field type "enable engineering mode" and click Done. Engineering Mode is now enabled.
